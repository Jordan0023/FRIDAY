## Static Findings

### Hard-coded credentials or secrets

Hard-coded secrets should be reviewed for default credentials, service tokens, or recoverable admin passwords.

Evidence: `password, token`

### Remote shell services present

Remote shell daemons increase attack surface and should be verified as disabled by default and authenticated safely.

Evidence: `DROPBEAR, Dropbear, dropbear, telnetd`

### HTTP CGI/admin attack surface

Web admin components should be reviewed for authentication bypass, command injection, and unsafe parameter parsing.

Evidence: `cgi-bin, uHTTPd, uhttpd`

### Command execution helpers

Command execution paths are common command-injection sinks when reachable from web or network inputs.

Evidence: `System, eval, popen, system`

### Potential memory-unsafe C functions

Unsafe C library calls can indicate buffer overflow risk; confirm whether inputs are bounded before use.

Evidence: `sprintf, strcat, strcpy`

## Extraction Notes

- binwalk -eM --directory known_firmware/extracted/79a57b80cec94f04 exited 0: WARNING: Extractor.execute failed to run external extractor 'jefferson -d 'jffs2-root' '%e'': [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'jefferson', 'jefferson -d 'jffs2-root' '%e'' might not be installed correctly

## Decompiler Notes

- Ghidra analyzeHeadless not found; decompiler import skipped.

## Validation Needed

These are static-analysis leads. Confirm reachability, affected versions, exploit preconditions, and vendor-fixed versions before treating any item as a vulnerability.
